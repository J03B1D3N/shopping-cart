so we gotta have three main components

this is going to be a skateshop

header with all the tabs: home, shop, contacts.

main that renders the selected tabs. information tab with a short description for HOME tab, all the items we sell in the SHOP tab, and locations and contacts in the CONTACTS tab.



Shop tab consists of boards, wheels, clutches, bearings, griptapes. lets aim for 5 of each.

after clicking on each item, we need to open up a selected product page with all the info on the product, the ability to choose how much of the product we want and ability to add it to the shopping cart.
